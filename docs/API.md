# Mocha's API Documentation

---

Congratulations! You've found Mocha's API documentation. These docs are for developers who wish to:

- Create an extension for Mocha, or
- Develop Mocha itself, or
- Do something else fancy with Mocha

Otherwise, **you probably want the [main documentation](https://mochajs.org)**.

## Exports Interface

The "exports" interface is useful for organizing tests in a modular fashion. However, please note that the "exports" interface is **not supported in browser environments**. This is due to the way browsers handle module exports, which differs from Node.js. If you need to organize your tests for a large OOP project, consider using the BDD or TDD interfaces instead.
